Alternative "english" ways of asking for your working directory:

Can we see what's in our production log?
you need to copy this file to a directory you feel safe to view it in with the
command cp log directory_name  (I only move it one directory at a time when I
was do the exercises.)  you can view the file using less log or more log

What does our database.yml look like?
If you have a datebase.yml in a directory use less datebase.ym or more datebase.ym.
It may ask a question that this file maybe binary, do you still want to view it.
Enter Y and you can view it.
