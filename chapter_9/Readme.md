Unix: Make a directory, change to it, and then make a file in it. Then change
one level up and run the rmdir command in this directory.  directory.
You should get an error. Try to understand why you got this error. 

You are not in the same file path, you can only delete directories for the same
file path.

Alternative "english" ways of asking you to create a file:

Can you touch blah.txt?
This makes an empty file blah.txt

Let's create foo.txt.
cd temp
touch foo.txt
this creates the foo.txt file in the temp directory.
