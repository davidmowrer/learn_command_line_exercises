Alternative "english" ways of asking for your working directory:

1. Can you rename foo.txt to blah.txt?
  mv foo.txt blah.txt

2. Can you move the production.log file in the log directory to slash temp?
  cd log
  mv production.log  / tmp

3. Can you zero out that file?
    make an empty file touch new_file
    mv new_file old_file  This will make old file a empty file.
